There are two type of depednecies we can installl
    1:Dev depednecies
    2:Normal depednecies
Q:what is Dev depednecies
Ans:when we say a dev depednecies it means it is generally requires for inner development phase when we are developing our app we require dev depednecies

Q:what is Normal depednecies
Ans:normal depednecies are used in production also

# diff between normal and dev depednecies
# so parcel is a bundler ,cunking,minification,is not done on production we wiil do this 
     in a development pahse so we will use PARCEL as a dev depednecies
     fo dev depednecies (npm install -D parcel) not a normal depednecies (-D for dev depednecies)
     PARCEL IS A beast it will do lot of thing for our app it is just like skeletion and parcel will give muscle ,strength ,power
     "parcel":"^2.8.3" here ^ is call carret ans when we put ^(carret)before version this means when any minor update is come it will update the parcel automatically ex=new version is 2..8.4 
     then  ^(carret) will automatically update it 

Q:What is package-lock.json (that come after parcel installation)
Ans: package-lock.json keeps a track of exact version that is being install Suppose  today 2.8.4 is released my package.jason will stay like this ok  my package.json ave ^(carret) on it
